# JavaScript implementation of Digital Circuits Simulation described at Part 3.3.4 of [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.4)


## Example
```
npm start
```
This will run simulation example from ./example/circuitSimulation.js
```
> Start simulation from time 0.
> Wire carry changed value to 1 at time:8
> Wire sum changed value to 1 at time:8
> Wire sum changed value to 0 at time:16
> Wire sum changed value to 1 at time:16
```
